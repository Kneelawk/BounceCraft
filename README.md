About BounceCraft2
------------------
BounceCraft and BounceCraft2 were and are mods that are designed to allow the
minecraft player to, to put it plainly, toss entities around.

The main difference between BounceCraft and BounceCraft2 is that BounceCraft2
has Forge Multipart compatibility, allowing the minecraft player to place more
than one of various blocks in one block's worth of space.
